        From torchbearer to transformer, Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata has played shepherd and sentinel while guiding the
        Tata group into a new age, and he has done it in his own distinctive style.
        <br><br>
        There are a host of reasons why Ratan Naval Tata is worthy of admiration, none more so than for the way he has
        sailed through the high tide of his life as head of the Tata group: with grace and a quiet dignity all too rare
        in the tumult and cacophony that characterise the mostly grubby, sometimes noble intersection of business and
        life in todayâ€™s India.
        The quietude is what sets him apart. You would expect a person such as Mr Tata, tall of stature and blessed with
        the typically striking looks of his Persian forbears, to stand out in a crowd. Not so the helmsman of the Tata
        group, whose solitary nature, humility and intense effort to shun the arch lights can make him seem almost
        invisible in any gathering. The rectitude and resolve behind this persona is of more consequence, though,
        defining as they have the shape and substance of a remarkable business conglomerate during what has been the
        most transformative period in its long and storied history.<br><br>
